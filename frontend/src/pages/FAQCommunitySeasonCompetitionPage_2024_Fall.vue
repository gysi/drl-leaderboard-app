        No, the tournaments are divided into seasons, just like the community season ranking,
        but normal tournaments don't play a role in the current competition.
        <br/><br/>
        However, there is one tournament that is of particular significance: the Grand Final, which marks the conclusion of the season.

        title="What counts as penality?"
        :msnry="msnry"
        :initially-expanded="router.currentRoute.value.query.card === 'bounce-penalty'"
      >
        To maintain fairness and authenticity in the competition, a penalty of 1 second will be applied for each significant bounce detected in a player's run. This decision was made following community feedback and a poll regarding the use of bounce techniques.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>What is a bounce?</b>
        <br/>
        In the context of the DRL Simulator, a bounce occurs when a drone hits a surface, such as the ground or a wall, and gains a speed boost from the collision. This can happen when the drone's angle and velocity allow it to ricochet off the surface, resulting in an unintended acceleration.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>How does it work?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>An algorithm analyzes replays to detect bounces that would result in damage. Bounces with very low angles or velocities are not counted.</li>
          <li>If a bounce is detected, a 1-second penalty is added to the player's time for each bounce.</li>
          <li>This penalty ensures that exploiting bounces for speed boosts is not beneficial.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        The penalty system aims to discourage the use of bounce techniques while still acknowledging runs that adhere to the game's mechanics.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Feedback and Adjustments:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The algorithm is continuously refined to reduce false positives. Players are encouraged to report any discrepancies they observe.</li>
          <li>Runs with penalties will be highlighted on the leaderboard for easy identification.</li>
        </ul>
