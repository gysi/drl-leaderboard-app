        <div class="text-h6">‚ö†Ô∏è Bounce Penalty Incoming ‚ö†Ô∏è</div>
        Following extensive community discussion and a poll, we're introducing a new bounce penalty system to ensure fair play and discourage unintended speed boosts. Here's the lowdown:
        <ul>
          <li><b>What's a Bounce?</b> A bounce occurs when your drone hits a surface and gains a speed advantage.</li>
          <li><b>The Penalty:</b> A 1-second penalty will be added to your time for each significant bounce detected in your replay.</li>
          <li><b>Why the Change?</b> To promote skillful piloting and maintain the integrity of the competition.</li>
          <li><b>How It Works:</b> A smart algorithm analyzes replays for bounces that would cause damage. Minor bumps won't be penalized.</li>
          <li><b>Transparency:</b> Runs with penalties will be clearly marked on the leaderboards.</li>
        </ul>
        We're committed to refining the algorithm to minimize false positives. If you believe a penalty was applied in error, please report it.
        <br/><br/>
        <div class="text-h6">üöÄ Race On!</div>
        We can't wait to see you master the Red Series tracks and adapt to the new penalty system. The competition is fiercer than ever, so give it your all and make your mark on the Summer Season!
